Hi! This is my Paint Project Submission for ICS3U.

The fonts folder is pretty much useless, I just used to make the text for the guide page
in aseprite. it is not used at all in the code.

Also, title_oval.png and paley.png isn't being used at all, it was for making the title.png image.

The theme is a custom theme made by me, and the mascot is Poto the ghost!
Poto is a cross between a ghost and a drop of white paint, with the theme of the program.

Enjoy the program!
